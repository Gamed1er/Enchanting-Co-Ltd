You can use this library in every version but some tags might be incomplete.<br>
Tags are fully complete up to version: `1.21`

Taglib is, as the name already said, a tags library.

It currently `adds 457` new blocks, entity, item, and biome tags for you to use.
With this library, you're prepared for everything you possibly wanna do in your data packs.

I always add new tags to hopefully make it the biggest and best tags library to ever exist
and to eventually cover everything you could potentially need.

If you want to add some tags yourself, you can use references to other tags to make it easier to write them and then at the end run the `tag_dereferencer` to automatically convert tag references to the actual entries in that tag. The executable has to be in the root directory of Taglib to work.

If you consider using this library in your data pack please mention this pack.
